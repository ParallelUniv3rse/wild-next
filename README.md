## Introduction

While we were building our own SSR stack suddenly zeit/next popped up and just did everything right. Moving from our rather custom solution to next we came accustomed to a certain workflow and syntax, so we decided to ditch the old stuff and create a sane base configuration to kickoff new projects.

If you are familiar with `next` and `cssnext`, then you don't have to read all of the following, just `npm i or yarn` your way to start off.

## Usage

`npm i` or `yarn` once to install dependencies.
`npm run dev` to start working locally.
`npm run build` to build for production.
`npm start` to run in production.
TBD: static rendering into plain html

## Folder structure

pages
components
elements
services
static
TBD

The `/pages` convention is pretty nifty and forces you to do bright decisions and poses a simple way for a new developer that works on the project to understand which comp is rendered from which route. Think the React way, for example if you want to use a layout across pages, simply create a component, call it for example `Layout` and use it as the top-level component inside your `pages`:

```
export default () => (
  <Layout>
    <div>Hello World.</div>
  </Layout>
)
```

## Images / Static Files

Sometimes back to the roots is nice. Simply put your stuff into `/static` and reference it as usual. The only exception are SVGs that you'd like to inline. In that case import the svg and use it as JSX:

```js
import Cat from '../static/images/cat.svg';
// further down in your render()
<Cat />
```

## Javascript

Next runs mostly on convention over configuration, we'll highlight a few important pieces here, but for all your questions, simply head to their [zeit/next repository](https://github.com/zeit/next.js) to get all your questions answered.
Most importantly, your can safely write next-generation code and expect it to be transpiled (eg. `await/async`), to be exact we go as far as `stage-0`.

INFO TBD:
Head
Routing
Static Files
Fetching Data

## CSS Styles

This one is something to get accustomed to, but we're ditching our beloved sass syntax for the syntax that is drafted for the official CSS spec. Although these specs are not yet respected by all browser vendors, we simply transpile them so they work today. Here's an overview of things that you are used to do, but now are done probably differently:

<details>
<summary><strong>Nesting</strong></summary>

Nesting is done through the syntax of the [CSS Nesting Module Level 3](http://tabatkins.github.io/specs/css-nesting/)

```css
/* before */
a, b {
  color: red;
  & c, & d {
    color: white;
  }
  & & {
    color: blue;
  }
  &:hover {
    color: black;
  }
  @media (min-width: 30em) {
    color: yellow;
    @media (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5) {
      color: green;
    }
  }
}
/* after */
a, b {
  color: red;
}
a c, a d, b c, b d {
  color: white;
}
a a, b b {
  color: blue;
}
a:hover, b:hover {
  color: black;
}
@media (min-width: 30em) {
  a, b {
    color: yellow;
  }
}
@media (min-width: 30em) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5) {
  a, b {
    color: green;
  }
}
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Imports</strong></summary>

We don't have CSS importing. And that has a reason. Importing was necessary to organize SCSS code because in the end we compiled to one monolithic .css file. With the new approach of organizing styles along with their respective components this feature simply is not necessary anymore. If there is data you need to share across components (and their respective styles) it makes much more sense to store it in a .js or .json file and import this data into your component and then use it. This also solves the age old problem of Javascript-Stylesheet-Interoperability.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Variables</strong></summary>

See the point `Imports` above. Classic scss $variables are simply not needed anymore, just use regular Javascript variables. Since you write the styles in a template literal in JSX, you can even go all the way to using expressions. To share variables across files, simply put them in a seperate file and important where you need them in classic Javascript fashion. That being said if you happen to find a usecase where that doesn't make sense, you can use [CSS Custom Properties for Cascading Variables Module Level 1](http://www.w3.org/TR/css-variables/) to define variables within css. **Be aware that the definitions are limited to :root selector!**

```css
:root {
  --mainColor: red;
}
a {
  color: var(--mainColor);
}
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Mixins</strong></summary>

Sometimes you felt like repeating yourself and you used a Sass-Mixin to keep things DRY. Before you overthink things â€“ maybe you can simply use your good old friend JavaScript to do the heavy lifting for you? If that's not applicable you can use the [CSS @apply Rule](https://tabatkins.github.io/specs/css-apply-rule) to define variables within css. **Be aware that the definitions are limited to :root selector!**

```css
:root {
  --danger-theme: {
    color: white;
    background-color: red;
  };
}
.danger {
  @apply --danger-theme;
}
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Media Queries</strong></summary>

There's not much to say here, other than we have the two upcoming features of [Custom Media Queries](http://dev.w3.org/csswg/mediaqueries/#custom-mq) and [Media Query Ranges](https://drafts.csswg.org/mediaqueries/#mq-ranges) transpiled in our build.

**Custom Media Queries**
A nice way to have semantic media queries.

```css
@custom-media --small-viewport (max-width: 30em);
/* check out media queries ranges for a better syntax !*/

@media (--small-viewport) {
  /* styles for small viewport */
}
```

**Media queries ranges**
Allows to replace min-/max- with <= & >= (syntax easier to read).

```css
@media (width >= 500px) and (width <= 1200px) {
  /* your styles */
}
/* or coupled with custom media queries */
@custom-media --only-medium-screen (width >= 500px) and (width <= 1200px);
@media (--only-medium-screen) {
  /* your styles */
}
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Colors</strong></summary>

If you used the nice color functions from Sass and are missing them now, you have two options: Use [any Javascript function](https://github.com/Qix-/color) in your style-jsx since, well, in the end it's just JavaScript!

Or, if you want to stick to CSS syntax, use the functions that will be available in future CSS versions: Check out the [cssnext features page](http://cssnext.io/features) where there's a list of things you can use.

## Dev-Ops Helpers

Here's a sample nginx reverse proxy config:

```
location / {
  # default port, could be changed if you use next with custom server
  proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;

  proxy_http_version 1.1;
  proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
  proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
  proxy_set_header Host $host;
  proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;

  # if you have try_files like this, remove it from our block
  # otherwise next app will not work properly
  # try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
}
```

Here's a sample pm2 line to start the server:

```bash
pm2 start npm --name "next" -- start
```
